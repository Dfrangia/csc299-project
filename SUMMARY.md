CSC 299 Final Project Summary

For my final project in CSC 299, I created a terminal-based diet and calorie tracking application that integrates the Edamam Nutrition API and the OpenAI API. My goal was to develop software that would be genuinely useful to me and to other potential users rather than produce a standard task manager. Because I care about nutrition and regularly track what I eat, a diet tracker felt like a meaningful and practical choice. The project reflects three guiding principles that shaped all major decisions: data integrity, user experience, and reliable error handling.I also used version control throughout the project to preserve a fine-grained commit history, which helped track changes and document the evolution of the code.

A central priority was ensuring the accuracy of the nutrition information returned to the user. While a large language model can estimate calorie values, it cannot provide verified nutritional data. I researched multiple nutrition APIs, compared the quality of their databases, and reviewed free-tier limits. Edamam stood out because it uses a real nutrition database rather than approximations. Although integrating a second API added complexity, the choice aligned with my commitment to providing accurate information that users could trust. I still implemented a fallback system where the OpenAI API can estimate calorie information if Edamam keys are unavailable, but Edamam remains the primary source of truth. I also placed significant emphasis on creating a user-friendly experience in the terminal environment. Real users type commands inconsistently, make spelling errors, and use different forms of the same instruction. My early implementation with simple string matching made the interface too rigid, so I switched to regular expressions for command parsing. This allowed the program to recognize various input styles, accommodate different capitalizations, and accept multiple exit commands. These improvements made the application more natural to use and reduced user frustration. The class assignments throughout the quarter influenced the overall structure of the project. Task 1 reinforced how to design JSON workflows, which helped me structure the food logs as lists of dictionaries containing names, quantities, calories, timestamps, and ISO-formatted dates. Task 2 introduced a chat-style loop pattern that became the basis for my interactive terminal interface. Task 3, which focused on pytest, strengthened my debugging process even though I did not formalize tests for the final project. I frequently tested small components while building features and applied a test-driven mindset. Task 4 taught me how to integrate the OpenAI API, manage keys, design prompts, and handle errors. These skills shaped the implementation of the recommendation system. Task 5 encouraged planning and modular design, which led me to divide the application into separate files for storage, food logic, API calls, and agents.

Throughout development, I used ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to support my workflow, but I did so with consistent oversight. With ChatGPT, I would describe a feature and receive suggestions for structuring functions or modules. I then implemented, tested, and revised those suggestions. Copilot was particularly helpful for repetitive boilerplate code, but I reviewed every generated line to ensure correctness. This iterative process helped me work efficiently while maintaining a clear understanding of the underlying logic. Several challenges arose during development. Initially, I attempted to include additional features such as meal categories and advanced filtering. I later realized that these additions would distract from the core functionality required for the assignment, so I simplified the scope. Parsing the Edamam response was another learning experience because the nutritional data is deeply nested within the returned JSON. I also addressed practical issues such as handling missing data directories, preventing crashes from malformed files, and managing cases where API keys are not set. These challenges ultimately improved the stability and reliability of the application.

This project demonstrates more than the ability to write code. It shows that I can research and integrate external APIs, design data structures for persistent storage, organize code into maintainable modules, and develop a forgiving and user-centered interface. It also reflects the values that shape how I approach software: accuracy, reliability, and thoughtful design. By deliberately choosing Edamam for verified calorie data, using regular expressions to handle user input flexibly, and implementing detailed error handling at every stage, I created an application that offers both practicality and trustworthiness. Building this diet tracker strengthened my understanding of how to plan, develop, and debug a multi-component software project. It also reinforced the importance of designing with the user in mind and maintaining data integrity throughout the entire system. Although the program is simple, it reflects the skills and priorities I have developed in this course and illustrates the kind of developer I aim to become.
